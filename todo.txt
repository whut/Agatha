Merged containers
Lepszy pomysł: zrób ilmergiel połaczone dllki:)

I have another pull proposition, this time a bit controversial:)

 I merged container projects into Agatha.Common. This way there is less projects to compile, so its faster, and less dlls to distribute so it is less 
troublesome;). I never saw such approach in .NET projects, but it's common in Java (having integration code with other frameworks in one jar instead of separate 
jars per single other framework).
